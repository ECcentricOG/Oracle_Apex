List of Values : like key Values pairs but named as Display Value and Return Value

Static LOVs
Based on entered text values.
Steps to Create:
Navigate to Shared Components > List of Values > Create.
Enter name and type as Static, then provide display and return values.
Save the LOV, which can be used for items like checkboxes, radio groups, and select lists.

Dynamic LOVs
Based on a SQL query or function body.
Steps to Create:
Go to Shared Components > List of Values > Create.
Enter name and set type as Dynamic.
Choose data source (e.g., SQL query) and specify the display and return columns.
Save and link the LOV to page items like select lists, shuttles, or pop-ups.

Cascading LOVs
One LOV depends on another's selection.
Steps to Create:
In Page Designer, create the first select list item with an LOV SQL query.
For the second item, use a SQL query that references the first item in the WHERE clause.
Set the Cascading LOV Parent Item to the first item, then save.
