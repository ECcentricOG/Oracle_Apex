Validations in APEX are checks that ensure data entered by users meets certain conditions before it is saved to the database.

SQL Validation: Uses SQL expressions to validate data.
PL/SQL Validation: Uses PL/SQL code to implement more complex checks.

Creating a Validation in APEX
Example: Ensuring Commission is Not More Than 50% of Salary

Locate the Item:
Find the item (e.g., COMMISSION) and right-click on it.
Select Create Validation.
Configure the Validation:
Validation Type: Choose Expression and set Language to SQL.
Condition: Define the validation rule, for instance:
:COMMISSION <= 0.5 * :SALARY
Error Message: Set a custom message, like "Commission cannot exceed 50% of the salary."
Display Options:
Set Associated Item to the form field (e.g., COMMISSION) so that the error appears in context.
Display Location: Choose Inline with Field to show the error next to the item, or Notification to display it at the top of the page.
