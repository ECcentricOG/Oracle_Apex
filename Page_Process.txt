Page processes : units of logic executed at specific points during page rendering or page submission.

Page Processes During Submission
When the user submits a form, a page process can handle data updates, such as saving to a database.
Example: Using Automatic Row Processing (DML) to save changes made in a form.

Application Processes
blocks of PL/SQL logic that can be executed across multiple pages in an application.
Application processes can be set to run On Load, On Submit, or On Demand (triggered by custom events or conditions).

Example: Creating a Page Process
To create a page process that initializes page items:

Go to the page in Page Designer.
Right-click on a process point (e.g., Before Header, After Header) under Rendering or Processing.
Select Create Process and set Process Type to PL/SQL Code.
Define your logic. For example, to initialize the SALARY item:
:SALARY := NULL;
Save and test the page.
