Forms : essential components for data input and submission, enabling users to add, update, or delete records in a database.
        created as a new page or as a region within an existing page, and they allow developers to control how data is gathered and managed in applications.

Types of Forms : 
Standard Form: Used to update a single row in a table or SQL query.
Interactive Grid: Displays data in a customizable report format, allowing users to edit multiple rows directly within the grid.
Master-Detail Form: Presents related data in a parent-child relationship, with master and detail sections shown either stacked, side-by-side, or via drill-down.

Linking a Report to a Form : 
To enable data editing directly from a report, you can link an interactive or classic report to a form:
Open the Report in Page Designer.
Select the Report Region under the Rendering section.
In the Property Editor, set Link to Custom Target and define the form page as the target.
Specify the Item and Value to pass to the form (e.g., P3_ID for the item and ID for the value).
Save, then run the page to test the link functionality.

Modifying and Customizing Forms :
Quick Edit:
Use Quick Edit from the Runtime Developer toolbar to make instant changes to form items, labels, and regions without opening Page Designer.

Changing Item Types:
In Page Designer, change item types (e.g., converting a text field to a select list) directly from the Property Editor by setting up the List of Values and SQL Query.

Reordering Items:
Drag and drop items within the Rendering Tree or the central pane to rearrange their display order.
