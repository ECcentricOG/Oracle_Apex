Smart Filters : Oracle APEX provide an efficient way to search and filter large datasets on a page.
                A Smart Filters page combines a main search field and filter "chips" at the top with a results report at the bottom.
                
Unlike Faceted Search, Smart Filters use a compact layout, making them ideal for scenarios where space is limited.

Adding and Customizing Smart Filters
Add a New Filter:
Open the Smart Filters page in Page Designer.
Go to the Search Region, right-click on Filters, and select Create Filter.

Configure the Filter:
In the Property Editor, define filter attributes:
    Name: Specify the display name (e.g., “Category”).
    Type: Choose how users will interact with the filter (e.g., Checkbox Group, Radio Button, Range).
    Source: Map the filter to a specific column (e.g., CATEGORY column).
    Data Type: Set to the appropriate type (e.g., VARCHAR2).

Enable Client-Side Filtering:
For filters with numerous options, enable Client-Side Filtering:
Click on the filter, navigate to List Entries in the Property Editor.
Enable Client-Side Filtering to add a search field above the filter list for easier value selection.
